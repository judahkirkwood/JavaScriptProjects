## Pizza Menu

This is a workup of an interactive menu that would be used to create custom orders for your pizza, including size, toppings, etc., and then giving a price.

## TicTacToe Game

This classic game lets you play against the computer. Taking turns, you are trying to get 3 of your squares in a row, either vertically, diagonally, or horizontally.

## Calculator

This is a fully functional computer capable of performing basic mathematical functions and returning the answer.

## Todo App

You can make yourself a list of things you would like to be completed and check them off as you do.
